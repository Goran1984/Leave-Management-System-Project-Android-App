# Leave-Management-System-Project-Android-App

It’s a leave management system project, used in any organization. The Leave Management module in the company allows its employees to 
manage their own leaves data. Employees can apply for leave via a mobile application (platform independent) and view their leave record 
with information on leaves availed, canceled along with the annual leave balance summary.  

All leave applications go through an automaticapproval process, wherein, the employee’s manager is informed of leave applications 
via an automatic email generated by the system or a notification in the app.
